## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I improved my searching skills on google, I remembered how to style certain
elements, and I learned new techniques such as using the shadow effect on the
container.

Here are some code snippets from my project. I enjoyed using classes in html,
using flexbox, and learning the shadow effect in css:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
<div class="flex-container">
  <div class="qr-box">
    <img src="images/image-qr-code.png" alt="" />
    <p class="improve">
      Improve your front-end <br />skills by building projects
    </p>
    <p class="coding">
      Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to
      the next level
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}

.qr-box {
  background-color: white;
  border: 2px solid;
  border-radius: 5%;
  width: 225px;
  height: 350px;
  margin: 10px;
  padding: 20px;
  font-size: 30px;
  border-style: none;
  -webkit-filter: drop-shadow(5px 5px 5px #222);
  filter: drop-shadow(5px 5px 5px #222);
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to continue to learn more about css flexbox and css grid to better
understand how they interact on the browser.

### Useful resources

- [Complete Guide to
  Flexbox]https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/#aa-background -
  This helped me with flexbox concepts when styling the project
- [Stack Overflow for the dropshadow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3186688/drop-shadow-for-png-image-in-css) -
  This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand how to design a
  drop-shadow effect on an element. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning
  this concept.
